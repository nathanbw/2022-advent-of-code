         * Puzzle 1 is asking us to find which characters exist in the first /and/ second half of a string. There will
         * only be one character that appears in both halves of the string, but it can occur multiple times, e.g.,
         * abazxbbx could happen (b shows up twice in second half) but abazxabx couldn't (a and b show up in second half)
         *
         * Once you've found which "type" (character) repeats in each string, find the priority for that type, and add
         * it to the total. Return the total.
         *
         * Waffles's take: The requirements were subtle and hard to tease out. Two major missteps I took:
         * 1. Assuming we only wanted to count the priority of each unique type that was duplicated in any rucksack.
         *    e.g.: abaa\nabaa would yield a total of 1, since "a" was the only duplicated type in all rucksacks
         * 2. Assuming we wanted to sum up the total of all duplicated types for each rucksack, so if "a" was duplicated
         *    twice in the same rucksack, the total would be 2. This was just a bug on my part -- this was clearly
         *    accounted for in the example in the requirements
         *
         * I think number 1. above could have been avoided if the example in the requirements included at least two
         * rucksacks that had the same duplicated character
